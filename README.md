## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. I specialize in embedded firmware development, particularly within UNIX-based environments. I also have experience in backend software development, including API design and backend web development, which I thoroughly enjoy exploring alongside my core interests.
